# CardGame
Simple game with random card generation

The following project utilizes the .NET Framework to generate random cards. Each player draws 5 cards, while each card has random stats assigned to it such as health, attack, name, and weapon.

The plan is to allow each player to draw 5 cards and play them one-by-one, allowing the player to either attack, with character cards, or allow the player to change their stats via buff cards.
